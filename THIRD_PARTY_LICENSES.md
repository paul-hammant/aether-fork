# Third-party licenses

Portions of Aether's standard library and contrib modules are ported from
third-party open-source projects. Each ported source file carries an
attribution header naming its upstream; this file reproduces the upstream
licence texts in full. Where a module is original to Aether it is *not* listed
here.

## Bouncy Castle (bc-csharp) — MIT License

Used by the cryptography port (issue
[#739](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/issues/739)). Files that port
logic, structure, or test vectors from Bouncy Castle for .NET carry the
attribution header:

```

Ported so far:

- `std/bits/` (`std.bits`) — bit helpers ported from `crypto/src/util/Integers.cs`
  and `crypto/src/util/Longs.cs` (rotate / leading-zeros / popcount).
- `std/bytes/` big-endian accessors (`set_be16/32/64`, `get_be16/32/64`) —
  modelled on `crypto/src/crypto/util/Pack.cs`.
- `std/bits/test_bits.ae`, `tests/regression/test_bytes_be.ae` — test vectors
  ported from `crypto/test/src/util/utiltest/{IntegersTest,LongsTest}.cs`.

## shopspring/decimal — MIT License

Used by `std.decimal` (issue
[#2067](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/issues/2067)). The module
ports the representation (coefficient and base-10 exponent), the rescaling
and rounding rules, and the division algorithm (`QuoRem` / `DivRound`) from
the Go library, and carries the attribution header:

//

```

Ported so far:

- `std/decimal/module.ae` (`std.decimal`) — ported from `decimal.go`.
- `std/decimal/test_decimal_*.ae` — expected values checked against the
  library's documented behaviour.

## PCRE2 — BSD-3-Clause (with binary-redistribution exemption)

Used by `std.regex` (issue
[#1389](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/issues/1389)). The directory
`std/regex/pcre2/` is a byte-identical vendored subset of upstream PCRE2
(<https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2>), pinned by version and SHA-256 in
`std/regex/pcre2/VENDOR.md` and regenerated only by
`scripts/vendor-pcre2.sh`. It carries no local patches; three files keep the
alternate names upstream itself designates for non-autotools embedding
(`pcre2.h`, `config.h`, `pcre2_chartables.c`). The upstream licence text,
also present as `std/regex/pcre2/LICENCE`:

```
PCRE2 LICENCE
-------------

PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Releases 10.00 and above of PCRE2 are distributed under the terms of the "BSD"
licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary
redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory,
is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the
testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
the library is built.

ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------

The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently.

[#739](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/issues/739),
[#1298](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/issues/1298)). The
directory `tests/vectors/wycheproof/` holds byte-identical **test-vector

there. Vectors are data consumed by tests, not compiled code. Apache-2.0:
