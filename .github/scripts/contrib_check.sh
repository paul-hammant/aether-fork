# contrib_check.sh — build + RUN every contrib test_*.ae (not just type-check).
#
# The nightly used to only `ae check` (type-check) contrib modules — which is
# exactly what failed to catch the tinyweb WebSocket server rot (it compiled
# fine; it was runtime-broken). This runs the actual tests, so runtime and (with
# VALGRIND=1) leak regressions surface.
#
# Usage:
#   .github/scripts/contrib_check.sh            # build + run each test
#   VALGRIND=1 .github/scripts/contrib_check.sh # ... under valgrind (leak gate)
#   LSAN=1 .github/scripts/contrib_check.sh     # LeakSanitizer gate (vulkan)
#   ONLY="metal/ vulkan/" .github/scripts/contrib_check.sh
#                                               # only the entries whose label
#                                               # starts with one of these
#
# Assumes ./build/ae is already built (the Makefile target depends on it).
# Exits nonzero if any contrib test fails to build, fails at runtime, or (under
# valgrind) leaks. Each test binary is expected to self-terminate — the tinyweb
# server tests run an in-process client+server and exit(0)/exit(1) on their own.

# Why some tests are run-only under valgrind: the tinyweb tests were written to
# `exit()` on completion (and the server tests keep an actor blocked in an

# cleanup — valgrind reports the still-live buffers as "leaks" even though the

# actually caught the WS rot); making them leak-clean is separate follow-up
# work. i18n/collate was written leak-clean by design, so it IS leak-gated.
