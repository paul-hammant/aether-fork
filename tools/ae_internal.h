/* Aether `int` wraps; C `int` overflow is undefined. -fwrapv is what closes
 * that gap, and it belongs on every command line that compiles generated C.
 *
 * docs/language-reference.md (W1003) already states the contract: a constant
 * fold "wraps exactly as the runtime would", specifically so that the literal
 * form and the same expression written over `int` variables cannot disagree.
 * Without this flag they did, from -O2 upward. GCC 15.2 folded
 *
 *     g_seed = (g_seed * 1103515245 + 12345) & 0x7FFFFFFF
 *
 * down to a three-value cycle: the mask proves g_seed >= 0, "a signed multiply
 * does not overflow" then proves g_seed <= 2^31 / 1103515245, and value-range
 * propagation takes it from there. `ae run` was unaffected (-O0), so the
 * miscompile reached shipped binaries only -- #1957, found as a black window in
 * ae3d's black_hole example, whose 200,000 particles were all seeded from the
 * collapsed generator.
 *
 * Every GCC and Clang the project targets accepts it, zig cc included. What it
 * costs is a narrow class of loop optimisations that rely on a signed
 * induction variable not wrapping; the shape most exposed to that -- a 200M
 * iteration `int` loop doing multiply, divide and modulo -- measured 199 ms
 * either way on GCC 15.2 x86_64. The hand-written runtime is compiled by the
 * Makefile, not through here, and is unaffected: signed overflow there is a
 * bug rather than a defined operation. */
