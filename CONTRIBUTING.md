# Contributing to Aether

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Aether. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing code, tests, and documentation.

## Code Style

### General Guidelines

- Use 4-space indentation (no tabs), match the surrounding C, which is
  4-space throughout `compiler/`, `runtime/`, `std/`, and `tools/`
- Keep lines to a readable width; wrap long comments rather than long code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Comment the non-obvious (why, not what); the codebase leans heavily on
  explanatory comments at tricky codegen / ownership sites

### Naming Conventions

```c
// Types: PascalCase
typedef struct AetherModule { ... } AetherModule;

// Functions: snake_case
void parse_expression(Parser* parser);
ASTNode* create_ast_node(ASTNodeType type);

// Variables: snake_case
int token_count = 0;
const char* module_name = "std.io";

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
#define MAX_TOKENS 1000
#define DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE 4096

// Private functions: static with leading underscore (optional)
static void _internal_helper(void);
```

### File Organization

```c
// 1. Includes (system headers first, then local)
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "aether_types.h"
#include "aether_parser.h"

// 2. Constants and macros
#define MAX_BUFFER 256

// 3. Type definitions
typedef struct { ... } MyStruct;

// 4. Forward declarations
static void helper_function(void);

// 5. Global variables (avoid when possible)
static int global_counter = 0;

// 6. Function implementations
void public_function(void) {
    // Implementation
}

static void helper_function(void) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Memory Management

- Always check for `NULL` returns from allocation functions
- Free all allocated memory
- Use `defer` statement when available for automatic cleanup
- Run Valgrind to verify no memory leaks

```c
// Good
char* buffer = malloc(256);
if (!buffer) {
    return NULL;
}
// ... use buffer ...
free(buffer);

// Keep the acquire and its free visually paired, and free on every
// return path. `goto cleanup;` is the idiomatic C escape for functions
// with several early exits.
```

(The `defer` statement is an *Aether*-language feature that lowers to a
scope-exit free; it is not available in the runtime's C code, C
contributions free explicitly.)

## Stdlib modules

When adding a new module, decide first whether it belongs in `std/`
(stability commitment, shipped with every Aether build) or `contrib/`
(opt-in, can evolve without stability constraint). The rubric is in
[docs/stdlib-vs-contrib.md](docs/stdlib-vs-contrib.md).

Once you know the placement, follow the canonical module pattern in
[docs/stdlib-module-pattern.md](docs/stdlib-module-pattern.md).

The short version: fallible C functions get a `_raw` suffix and a
Go-style `(value, err)` Aether wrapper; pure/infallible functions stay
raw without a suffix; intentionally void fire-and-forget APIs (like
`log.write`) and DSL builders (like the `std.host` manifest builders)
don't get wrappers. See [std/fs/module.ae](std/fs/module.ae) for the
reference implementation.

### Changing a stdlib parameter's TYPE, grep all callers first

When a PR widens or replaces a parameter's type in a stdlib wrapper,
the canonical case is `int` → a tagged-int type like `Duration`, but
also `string` → an enum-like, or a positional arg → a struct, the old
call shape can still parse where the new type isn't yet enforced. The
`Duration` case in particular is now checked: passing a bare `int` /
`long` / `float` where a `Duration` is expected is rejected at compile
time ("Cannot pass … where Duration expected", `compiler/analysis/
typechecker.c`), for both extern and user-defined callees. But not every
type-widening has that guard, and a value that *does* slip through is
reinterpreted in the new unit (5 nanoseconds instead of 5 seconds, say)
a silent bug: green build, locally-passing test, CI failure on the
platform where the value matters.

So before merging a parameter-type change, grep the whole tree for
callers and update them rather than assuming the typechecker will catch
every stale call site:

```bash
# Callers of the wrapper you just changed
grep -rn "client\.set_timeout(" tests/ examples/ std/
grep -rn "server_set_keepalive(" tests/ examples/ std/

# Or, more generally, anything that compiles your wrapper-internal
# extern symbol, externs may surface in unexpected places.
grep -rn "http_request_set_timeout" tests/ examples/ std/
```

Bare integers at call sites that should now be a domain-typed value are
the most common miss; check `examples/` too, not just `tests/`.

## Adding Tests

### Test Structure

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory and use the test harness framework.

```c
#include "test_harness.h"

// Simple test
TEST(my_feature) {
    ASSERT_EQ(add(2, 3), 5);
    ASSERT_TRUE(is_valid("test"));
}

// Test with category
TEST_CATEGORY(hashmap_string_to_int, TEST_CATEGORY_COLLECTIONS) {
    // The plain hashmap_create takes an initial capacity plus the six
    // key/value function pointers; the string→int helper is the
    // one-argument convenience used across the collections tests.
    HashMap* map = hashmap_create_string_to_int(16);
    ASSERT_NOT_NULL(map);
    hashmap_free(map);
}
```

### Test Categories

- `TEST_CATEGORY_COMPILER` - Lexer, parser, type checker, code generator
- `TEST_CATEGORY_RUNTIME` - Actor system, scheduler, message passing
- `TEST_CATEGORY_COLLECTIONS` - HashMap, Set, Vector, PriorityQueue
- `TEST_CATEGORY_NETWORK` - HTTP, TCP, networking utilities
- `TEST_CATEGORY_MEMORY` - Arena allocators, memory pools, leak detection
- `TEST_CATEGORY_STDLIB` - Standard library functions
- `TEST_CATEGORY_PARSER` - Parser-specific tests
- `TEST_CATEGORY_OTHER` - Miscellaneous tests

### Assertion Macros

```c
ASSERT_TRUE(condition)          // Assert condition is true
ASSERT_FALSE(condition)         // Assert condition is false
ASSERT_EQ(expected, actual)     // Assert equality (integers)
ASSERT_NE(expected, actual)     // Assert inequality
ASSERT_STREQ(expected, actual)  // Assert string equality
ASSERT_STRNE(expected, actual)  // Assert string inequality
ASSERT_NULL(ptr)                // Assert pointer is NULL
ASSERT_NOT_NULL(ptr)            // Assert pointer is not NULL
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Type-check without compiling (skips codegen + link, much faster on iteration)
ae check file.ae

# All tests
make test

# Every C source with its own main() that no target links (runtime examples,
# micro-benchmarks, demos). They rot silently otherwise; this compiles each.
make check-standalone

# Specific category (when implemented)
./build/test_runner --category=collections

# With Valgrind
make test-valgrind

# With AddressSanitizer
make test-asan
```

### Aether-level tests (`std.spec` + `ae test`)

The `TEST(...)` macros above are the C unit layer. Tests written *in
Aether* use the `std.spec` BDD framework (`describe` / `it` /
`before_each` / `after_each`, plus flat and fluent assertions) and are
run by the `ae test` discovery runner. A test file is a standalone
program whose exit code is the verdict — `0` all-passed, non-zero
failed:

```aether
import std.spec

main() {
    fw = spec.init()
    spec.describe(fw, "calculator") {
        spec.it("adds") callback {
            spec.assert_eq(add(2, 3), 5, "2 + 3")
        }
        spec.it("prefers the fluent style") callback {
            spec.expect_int(abs(-7)).to_equal(7)
        }
    }
    spec.run_summary(fw)
}
```

```bash
ae test                    # every test_*.ae / *_test.ae under tests/
ae test path/to/file.ae    # one file
ae test --format=tap       # aggregated TAP v13 (or --format=aeocha-v1)
```

Name files `test_*.ae` or `*_test.ae` so `ae test` discovers them.
Assertions are soft (a failure records and continues), so prefer several
small checks over one compound condition. See
[docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) for the full assertion surface, the
fluent chain, custom matchers, and structured reporting.

The in-tree `.ae` regression suite (`tests/regression/*.ae`, run by
`make test-ae`) predates `std.spec` and mostly uses hand-rolled
`fail()` + `exit(1)`; that idiom still works and `ae test` reads its exit
code the same way. New Aether-level tests should prefer `std.spec`.

### Where a std module's tests live (#1584)

A stdlib module owns its unit tests: `std/<mod>/test_*.ae`, beside the
`module.ae` they cover, written against `std.spec` (the older hand-rolled
`fails = fails + ck(...)` shape still works). `make test-ae` sweeps them
with the rest of the suite, and the PR that changes `std/<mod>` shows its
tests in the adjacent hunk rather than three directories away.

- **They are tests, not payload.** Every copy site that ships `std/` —
  `make install`, `install.sh`, the three `release.yml` arms and
  `make test-release-archive` — strips `std/**/test_*.ae` again, and
  `test-release-archive` / `test-install` fail if one survives. Add a new
  copy site and you add the strip.
- **They are not modules.** The resolver only ever looks for
  `<path>/module.ae`, so `import std.deque.test_deque` cannot resolve
  (`tests/integration/std_spec_not_importable/` proves it). Never put a
  `module.ae` in a test directory.
- **Census or waiver.** `make check-tests` runs
  `tests/scripts/check_module_specs.py`: every `module.ae` under `std/`
  has a co-located spec, or a test under `tests/` that imports it, or a
  one-line waiver in that script saying where it is covered. A new module
  with none of the three fails the build. The waiver list only shrinks:
  a waiver for a module that gained a spec is itself a failure.
- **Adoption, not migration.** `tests/integration/` keeps everything
  cross-module or harness-shaped (shell drivers, server/client fixtures,
  ports), and the central regression files stay where they are — moving
  them breaks `git log --follow` and doc links. A module you are touching
  gains a co-located spec; `AE_SPECS_VERBOSE=1` on the census prints the
  remaining backlog.

### Two marker files a shell-test directory can carry

`make test-ae` hands each `tests/integration/<name>/` directory to a worker
and runs its `test_*.sh` drivers one after another, because two drivers in
one directory may share fixed ports or build outputs. Two markers change
that:

- **`DRIVERS_INDEPENDENT`** — the directory's drivers share nothing, so each
  becomes its own scheduling unit (the wycheproof suites, which otherwise
  serialise ~6 minutes onto one worker).
- **`NEEDS_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN`** — the directory cannot run without software
  this repository does not provision, so the default sweep leaves it out and
  `make test-optional` runs exactly those. The file's first line says what is
  needed and is printed when the target runs. A test that can only "pass" by
  skipping does not belong in a gate (#2132 §3); `AE_SWEEP_OPTIONAL=1 make
  test-ae` puts them back in for a run that has the toolchain.

## Pull Request Requirements

### Docs-only PRs: skip CI with `[skip actions]`

If a PR (or its commits) changes **only** Markdown / prose, `*.md`,
`docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, the README, comments-as-prose, and touches no
code, tests, build, or workflow files (`.c`, `.h`, `.ae`, `Makefile`,
`tools/`, `.github/`, `install.sh`), put **`[skip actions]`** in the
commit message. GitHub reads that token (also `[skip ci]` / `[ci skip]`)
from the branch's **HEAD commit** and skips the entire workflow run, so
a one-line doc fix doesn't spin up the dozen-runner build matrix.

```
docs: fix typo in getting-started [skip actions]
```

This conserves GitHub Actions minutes. Two cautions: it must be the HEAD
commit that carries the token (a docs-only PR with a later code commit
should NOT skip), and only use it when the change genuinely cannot
affect a build, anything under `.c` / `.ae` / `Makefile` / `tools/` /
`.github/` must run the full suite below. Skipping CI means the PR shows
no status checks, so a maintainer merges it on review alone.

### Before Submitting

Keep checked-in Aether source canonically formatted; CI enforces this
(`tests/integration/fmt_gate/`):

```bash
./build/ae fmt std examples tests
```

Run the full CI suite locally, this is the same suite that GitHub Actions runs:

```bash
make ci          # Full 9-step suite with -Werror (compiler, tests, examples, smoke tests)
HARDEN=1 make ci # Hardened-build sweep (-fstack-protector-all + _FORTIFY_SOURCE=2);
                 # required for any PR that touches C in compiler/, runtime/, or std/.
                 # Catches unchecked memcpy / printf-format-injection bugs early.
                 # See docs/build-system.md "Hardening" for the full flag rationale.
```

This covers your current platform. To verify cross-platform compatibility:

```bash
# Cooperative scheduler (all platforms, no Docker)
make ci-coop

# Windows cross-compilation (requires Docker or mingw-w64)
make docker-ci-windows       # Docker (recommended)
make ci-windows              # or: brew install mingw-w64 (macOS) / apt install mingw-w64 (Linux)

# WebAssembly (requires Docker)
make docker-ci-wasm

# ARM embedded (requires Docker)
make docker-ci-embedded

# All portability checks at once
make ci-portability
```

**Platform coverage:**

| Your platform | `make ci` covers | Cross-platform via Docker |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| macOS | macOS Clang | `docker-ci-windows`, `docker-ci-wasm`, `docker-ci-embedded` |
| Linux | Linux GCC | `docker-ci-windows`, `docker-ci-wasm`, `docker-ci-embedded` |
| Windows (MSYS2) | Windows MinGW | `docker-ci-wasm`, `docker-ci-embedded` (Docker on WSL2) |

**No OS can locally test another OS natively.** macOS cannot be virtualized on Linux/Windows. Windows build+run requires MSYS2. The Docker targets above provide cross-compilation syntax checking only. The one exception is Windows *runtime* behaviour: `tests/scripts/windows_wine_sweep.sh` cross-builds each test to a PE and executes it under Wine, which is exactly what CI's "Windows / runtime under Wine" lane does, and it runs on any workstation, arm64 Macs included, in seconds per file instead of a ten-minute CI round trip. See [Reproducing the Wine lane locally](docs/build-system.md#reproducing-the-wine-lane-locally). If your changes touch platform-specific code (`_WIN32`, `__APPLE__`, `system()`, file paths, symlinks, PATH lookup, process spawning, sockets), run that sweep, and still wait for the MSYS2 CI results before merging.

> **Gotcha, new runtime C symbols and the WASM build.** The `ci-wasm` target compiles a *hand-curated minimal* runtime source list (`RUNTIME_FILES` in the Makefile), **not** the main `RUNTIME_SRC`. If you add a `runtime/`/`std/` C file whose symbol the compiler *emits a call to* (e.g. a codegen startup hook), you must also add that file to the WASM list, or `wasm-ld` fails with `undefined symbol: …` even though every native platform links fine. Keep such symbols self-guarded so the WASM object is a portable no-op. Run `make docker-ci-wasm` whenever you add a runtime symbol that codegen references unconditionally.

### CI permutations run on every PR

GitHub Actions runs a matrix of builds on every pull request. Every target
must be green before a PR can be merged. Plan your code changes with this
matrix in mind:

(Exact runner labels move with GitHub's images and the workflow files;
treat `.github/workflows/` as authoritative and this as the shape.)

| Target | Compiler | What trips up PRs |
|---|---|---|
| **Linux GCC** | `gcc` | `-Werror` strictness; pedantic `-Wall -Wextra` |
| **Linux Clang** | `clang` | Different warning surface than GCC |
| **Linux Hardened** | `gcc`, `HARDEN=1` | `-fstack-protector` / `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` / format-security promoted to errors |
| **macOS ARM64 + x86_64** | Apple Clang | BSD-style tools; no `/proc`; different `stat(2)` fields; Gatekeeper on fresh binaries; intel-specific codegen corners |
| **Windows MSYS2** | MinGW-w64 GCC | `#ifdef _WIN32` branches actually execute; POSIX syscalls (`symlink`, `readlink`, `fork`, `execvp`, `pipe`) are absent or stubbed; `/bin/sh` / `rm` / `ln` not guaranteed; path separators; `_mkdir`/`_unlink` instead of `mkdir`/`unlink`; `$PATH` uses `;` not `:` |
| **`ci-coop`** | `gcc`, `AETHER_NO_THREADING` | Cooperative scheduler only, tests that assume pthreads / `spawn` semantics may behave differently |
| **AddressSanitizer** | Clang/GCC | Any use-after-free / leak in your new C code (runs on Linux and macOS) |
| **Valgrind** | Linux | Same, slower, catches a slightly different set |

(A local `make ci-windows` cross-builds with `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`;
the PR-gating Windows job is the native MSYS2 build above.)

The Windows targets are where most new-feature PRs fail first, because
the existing stdlib has `_WIN32` stubs for anything POSIX-specific
(symlinks, `fork`/`exec`, `readlink`, `/proc`, signals, dotfiles-by-default,
`:` as PATH separator). If your feature adds a new stdlib function, you
should assume Windows gets a stub that returns failure until a proper
Win32 backend lands, and your tests should **detect the stub and skip
gracefully** rather than assert success and crash the matrix.

### Coding for portability

Anticipate the CI permutations while writing the feature, not after the
first red build. A few patterns the stdlib and existing tests use:

**1. Detect the platform at the top of a test and skip the parts that
don't apply.** Aether programs can read `$OS` it's set to `Windows_NT`
on both MSYS2 and mingw-w64 (cmd.exe inherits it, bash picks it up). This
is cleaner than probing a stub function because the SKIP message
self-documents *why*:

```aether
import std.os
main() {
    if os_getenv("OS") == "Windows_NT" {
        println("SKIP os_which: Windows backend not yet implemented")
        return
    }
    // …POSIX-only assertions below…
}
```

**2. Alternatively, probe a call that's known to fail on the platforms
you haven't implemented.** Existing example:
`tests/syntax/test_await_io.ae` calls `net.pipe_open()` and prints
`SKIP: pipe() unavailable (non-POSIX platform)` if the return is
negative. This is useful when the platform boundary is narrower than
"all of Windows", e.g. a stub that happens to fail, or a feature that
depends on a capability you can't name directly.

**3. Split a test that has both portable and non-portable sub-cases.**
In `tests/syntax/test_fs_stdlib_bundle.ae`, `fs_mkdir_p` and `fs_unlink`
work on Windows (they wrap `_mkdir` / `_unlink`), but `fs_symlink`,
`fs_readlink`, and `fs_is_symlink` are stubbed. The test runs mkdir_p
and unlink on every platform, and wraps the symlink sub-cases in
`if is_windows == 0 { … }`. Each platform gets the coverage it can
actually provide.

**4. On the C side, stub don't fake.** When you add a POSIX function
to a stdlib `.c` file, wrap the real implementation in `#ifndef _WIN32`
and provide a Windows branch that returns 0 / NULL / -1 following
whatever convention the rest of the file uses. Do NOT try to emulate
the POSIX behavior using the closest Win32 API unless you've actually
tested it, the CI will catch it, but so will your users, and a stub
that fails loudly is better than a half-broken fake. File a follow-up
issue for the real Windows backend at the same time so it doesn't
rot.

**5. On the C side, use `<errno.h>` after every POSIX syscall, not
`system()` of an equivalent shell command.** `system("ln -s …")` doesn't
exist on Windows (no `/bin/sh`, no `ln`). Direct `symlink(2)` at least
has a clean `#ifndef _WIN32` boundary.

**5a. Aether `long` lowers to `int64_t` on every platform; on the C
side, use `int64_t` (or `long long`), never C `long`.** On Windows
(LLP64) C `long` is 32-bit; on LP64 Linux/macOS it's 64-bit. If a
stdlib C function whose return is exposed as Aether `long` declares the
return type as C `long`, the function writes 4 bytes into Aether's
8-byte slot on Windows and either truncates large values or sign-extends
garbage into the upper 32 bits. Same hazard for out-parameters
(`long*` → `long long*` / `int64_t*`) and parsers (`strtol` →
`strtoll`). PR #562 (`fix(std.string): to_long 64-bit on Windows
too`, commit `8df0c4c`) is the canonical instance, Linux CI was happy,
Windows CI surfaced the truncation. Default to `int64_t` from
`<stdint.h>` for explicit width; reach for `long long` only when an
older library API forces your hand.

**5b. POSIX typedefs that MinGW doesn't have, cast through `long` or
`int64_t` at the assignment site.** Some typedefs are POSIX-only and
silently absent on MinGW, where the underlying struct fields are
plain integer types instead. Writing a literal cast through the POSIX
typedef name builds fine on Linux/macOS and fails compilation on the
Windows matrix runners with `error: 'X' undeclared`. The portable
play is to cast through the underlying type (which both sides accept
without warning), not the typedef.

| POSIX typedef | POSIX target type | MinGW field type | Portable cast |
|---|---|---|---|
| `suseconds_t` | `struct timeval.tv_usec` | `long` | `(long)` |
| `ssize_t` | `read`/`write` return | `intptr_t` / `int` | `(long long)` or `(intptr_t)` |
| `off_t` | `lseek` / `fseeko` | `long` (32-bit on MinGW unless `_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64`) | `(int64_t)` and use `_lseeki64` on Windows |

The general rule: if a cast names a typedef, check whether MinGW's
`<sys/types.h>` actually defines it. When in doubt, cast through the
explicit-width type from `<stdint.h>` or the plain integer type the
struct field declares it as.

**5c. In shell tests, BSD `sed -i` needs an explicit backup suffix;
GNU `sed -i` does not.** Linux ships GNU sed, macOS ships BSD sed.
`sed -i 's/a/b/' file.txt` works fine on Linux and **fails on
macOS** with `sed: 1: "…": invalid command code f` BSD sed reads
the next argument as the backup-suffix and parses the s-expression
as the file path. The portable shapes:

```bash
# BAD, Linux-only
sed -i 's/v1/v2/' "$file"

# GOOD, works on both BSD and GNU sed (the '' is the empty
# backup-suffix BSD sed wants; GNU sed treats it as a no-op file)
sed -i '' 's/v1/v2/' "$file"   # NB: only correct on BSD!

# BETTER, works everywhere because both seds accept -i<suffix>
sed -i.bak 's/v1/v2/' "$file" && rm "$file.bak"

# BEST when you don't actually need a regex, just rewrite the file
cat > "$file" <<'EOF'
new content
EOF
```

`sed -i ''` is BSD-only; GNU sed treats the empty string as a file
argument and errors. There is no single `sed -i` invocation that
parses identically under both. When the test only needs to swap a
literal value (the common shape in regression tests), prefer
rewriting the file with `cat > file <<EOF` fewer moving parts,
no backup file to clean up, and identical behaviour on every
platform.

**6. Prefer existing portable helpers over re-rolling your own path
handling.** `std/fs/aether_fs.c` provides `path_join`, `path_dirname`,
`path_basename`, `path_extension`, `path_clean`, `path_is_absolute`, and
`path_rel`. These already handle the cases where `/` and `\` both count as
separators (Windows C stdlib accepts either). Concatenating with `"/"` is
portable by accident; using the helpers is portable by design.

**7. When in doubt, run the tests under a forced `OS=Windows_NT` env
var locally.** It won't exercise actual `_WIN32` C branches (you need
mingw-w64 or Docker for that), but it will exercise the Aether-level
skip guards you wrote, which is where most per-test PR breakage lives:

```bash
OS=Windows_NT build/test_syntax_test_my_new_test
```

**8. `aether.toml` `[build] cflags` / `link_flags` support `${VAR}`
expansion, NOT `$(shell substitution)`.** The values are copied
verbatim into the gcc argv via `posix_spawnp` no shell runs over
them. `link_flags = "$(python3-config --ldflags --embed)"` reaches
gcc as literal text and fails. `link_flags = "${AETHER_X}"` is
expanded against the process environment by `ae` itself.

The env-var name is restricted to the `AETHER_*` allowlist for
security (so an attacker who can write env vars on CI can't hijack
the link line via `${LD_PRELOAD}` etc.). Unset names and
non-allowlisted names both warn to stderr and expand to empty.
`\$` is a literal `$`. Bare `$VAR` without braces is NOT expanded.

Practical contributor implication: when you add a new contrib bridge
that **link-binds** its host library at compile time (e.g. sqlite,
`libsqlite3` linked directly into the produced binary), name its env
contract `AETHER_<LANG>_LDFLAGS` / `AETHER_<LANG>_CFLAGS` so the
existing `${VAR}` allowlist accepts it without code changes here.

For bridges that **dlopen** their host library at runtime (python and,
in due course, lua/perl/ruby), users should NOT need to set
`${AETHER_<LANG>_LDFLAGS}` at all, `ae build` adds nothing
libpython-related to the link line, and the bridge dlopens
`libpython3.so` / etc. at first call. See `contrib/host/python/README.md`
for the canonical pattern (the `aether_host_python.c` rewrite that
landed v0.209.0). The optional `${AETHER_<LANG>_SONAME}` env var lets
the orchestrator supply a host-probed exact soname as a fallback when
the unversioned symlink isn't present (e.g. Debian).

**9. New `contrib/host/<lang>` bridges are auto-linked by `ae build`
when imported, do NOT ask users to repeat themselves.** `ae build`
scans the entry .ae for `import contrib.host.<lang>` and queues
`libaether_host_<lang>.a` onto the link line automatically (the .a
is built by `tests/scripts/contrib_build.sh`; install paths handled
by `make install-contrib`). Users only need to supply the host
language's own runtime link flags (for real-link bridges via
`${AETHER_<LANG>_LDFLAGS}` see §8 above) or nothing at all (for
dlopen bridges), never the bridge .a itself.

When adding a new bridge: the only step on the `ae` side is to
verify the .a name matches `libaether_host_<lang>.a` and lives next
to `libaether.a` (install) or in `build/contrib/` (dev). The scan
loop in `tools/ae.c` keys on the `<lang>` token after
`import contrib.host.` and needs no per-language code.

Prefer the **dlopen** shape for any new interpreter bridge:
- No `DT_NEEDED libfoo.so` in the produced binary → ABI-agnostic
  across deploy-host minor versions.
- No build-environment dependency on a `-dev` package at end-user
  `ae build` time (the toolchain image still needs the `-dev` kit
  to compile the bridge .a, via `aether-build --with=<lang>`).

  `dlopen("libfoo3.so", RTLD_NOW|RTLD_GLOBAL)` + `dlsym` table +
  `${AETHER_<LANG>_SONAME}` fallback pattern.

### Additional Checks

1. **No memory leaks**
   ```bash
   make docker-ci              # Includes Valgrind + ASan in Docker
   # Or locally if valgrind is installed:
   valgrind ./build/test_runner
   ```

2. **Add tests for new features**
   - New feature = new test
   - Bug fix = regression test

3. **Update documentation**
   - Add/update comments in code
   - Update README.md if adding user-facing features
   - Update docs/ if changing language behavior
   - Update CHANGELOG.md under `[current]`

   Every ```aether block in `docs/` and the README says what it is, and
   `make check-docs` holds it to that:

   | fence | meaning |
   |---|---|
   | ```` ```aether ```` | a complete program. **Compiled by CI**, so it cannot rot. |
   | ```` ```aether,fragment ```` | an excerpt: no `main`, or it uses names an earlier block introduced, or it contains a literal `...`. Not compiled. |
   | ```` ```aether,fails ```` | a deliberate counter-example. CI asserts it still does **not** compile. |

   `fragment` is not a way to park a broken example. If a block has a `main()`
   and is meant to work, leave the fence bare so it gets compiled.

### Review Process

1. Automated CI checks must pass, Linux (GCC, Clang, and a hardened GCC
   build), macOS, Windows (MSYS2 + MinGW-w64), and the AddressSanitizer /
   Valgrind memory-safety jobs
2. Code review by maintainer
3. Address feedback
4. Merge when approved

## Code review heuristics

The patterns below come up often in review. Each example contrasts a
weak form (BAD), an acceptable form (GOOD), and where applicable a
stronger form (BETTER). Use them as a checklist before sending a PR.

### Memory Management

```c
// BAD: Memory leak
char* create_string(void) {
    char* str = malloc(100);
    strcpy(str, "test");
    return str;  // Caller must remember to free
}

// GOOD: Document ownership
// Returns: Newly allocated string (caller must free)
char* create_string(void) {
    char* str = malloc(100);
    strcpy(str, "test");
    return str;
}

// BETTER: Use arena allocation
char* create_string(Arena* arena) {
    char* str = arena_alloc(arena, 100);
    strcpy(str, "test");
    return str;  // Freed when arena is freed
}
```

### Error Handling

```c
// BAD: Ignoring errors
FILE* f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
fread(buffer, 1, 100, f);  // Crashes if f is NULL

// GOOD: Check for errors
FILE* f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
if (!f) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to open file\n");
    return -1;
}
defer(fclose(f));
```

### Platform-Specific Code

```c
// BAD: Linux-specific
#include <unistd.h>
usleep(1000);

// GOOD: Cross-platform
#ifdef _WIN32
    #include <windows.h>
    Sleep(1);  // milliseconds
#else
    #include <unistd.h>
    usleep(1000);  // microseconds
#endif
```

## Versioning and Release Process

Aether uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Releases are fully automated.

### How it works

1. **Source of truth**: Git tags (`v*.*.*`). The `VERSION` file is kept in sync for non-git contexts (release tarballs, binary installs).

2. **Automatic release**: Every merge to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:
   - Computes the next version from the highest existing `v*.*.*` tag
   - Updates the `VERSION` file on `main` and commits `chore: release X.Y.Z`
   - Tags the commit and pushes both to `main` and the tag
   - Builds binaries for Linux, macOS (arm64 + x86_64), and Windows
   - Creates a GitHub Release with all artifacts

3. **Version bump rules**:
   - Commit message starts with `major` → bumps MAJOR (e.g., 0.17.0 → 1.0.0)
   - Anything else → bumps MINOR (e.g., 0.17.0 → 0.18.0)

4. **Race prevention**: The workflow uses a `concurrency` group, if two PRs merge in quick succession, the second release queues until the first completes.

### Where the version appears

| Component | How it gets the version |
|-----------|------------------------|
| `make ae` / `make compiler` | Makefile reads `git tag -l`, falls back to `VERSION` file |
| `ae version` | Compiled-in via `-DAETHER_VERSION` from Makefile |
| `aetherc --version` | Compiled-in via `-DAETHER_VERSION` from Makefile |
| `install.sh` | Reads `VERSION` file |
| Release tarballs | `VERSION` file baked into the archive |
| Windows native builds | Reads `VERSION` file (no git dependency) |

### For contributors

- **Never edit the `VERSION` file manually**, it's updated automatically by the release workflow
- **Never create `v*.*.*` tags manually**, let the workflow handle it
- **Always record what you changed** when adding features or fixes (see below)

### Changelog convention: a fragment of your own

Write your entry into a **file of its own** under `new_changelogs/`:

```bash
make add-changelog SECTION=fixed SLUG=2162-struct-collision
$EDITOR new_changelogs/20260922T174500Z-fixed-2162-struct-collision.md
```

Put the bullet in that file exactly as it should read under the version
heading. That is the whole obligation — a daily job folds settled fragments
into `CHANGELOG.md`, and a release folds everything pending.

**Why not edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly?** Because every PR that does is
editing the same lines: `## [current]` at the top. Those lines are what a
release *renames* (`[current]` → `[0.708.0]`), so when a release is cut
while your branch is open, merging the new `main` folds your entry **into
the released section** — and git reports no conflict, because the headings
merge cleanly and only your bullets end up in the wrong place. That has hit
four PRs in a row across 0.661–0.664 and several since. With a file per
change, two PRs cannot touch the same line.

Editing `## [current]` directly is still accepted (for a correction to a
released section's wording, say), and `make check-changelog` still catches
the fold. But a fragment cannot be folded in the first place.

**Do not invent a version number.**

When your PR merges to `main`, the release pipeline automatically:
1. Computes the next version from the highest existing git tag
2. Replaces `## [current]` with `## [X.Y.Z]` (the new version number)
3. Commits the updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION` file
4. Tags, builds, and publishes the release

**Example workflow:**

```markdown
## [current]

### Added
- My new feature description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description
```

After merge, the pipeline transforms this into:

```markdown
## [0.22.0]

### Added
- My new feature description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description
```

**Rules:**
- Use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) categories: `Added`, `Fixed`, `Changed`, `Removed`, `Deprecated`
- One `[current]` section at a time, if it already exists, add your entries to it
- If `[current]` is missing, create it at the top (below the header)
- Keep entries concise but specific, mention what changed and why

**Run `make check-changelog` before you push.** If a release is cut while your
branch is open, merging main renames `## [current]` into that version and folds
your entry into the released section, with no git conflict to warn you. CI reds
on it, but only after a full matrix run. `make check-changelog` is the identical
check (`tests/scripts/check_changelog_fold.sh`, which the CI job calls), so it
gives the same answer in under a second:

```bash
make check-changelog
```

It fails if the released sections no longer match `origin/main`, or if there is
not exactly one `## [current]`.

### `### Upgrade notes` for memory-fix releases

When a PR touches `compiler/codegen/codegen_stmt.c` (the heap-string-tracker wrapper), `std/string/aether_string.c` (the refcount allocator), or anything else that changes when the runtime frees a heap-allocated value, add an `### Upgrade notes` block to the same `[current]` entry. The block names the alias / ownership patterns whose downstream behaviour the change can break, and gives a recommended pre-upgrade play.

The hazard the section guards against: a memory-fix release that closes a leak can flip latent UAFs in downstream code from "harmless slow leak" to "hard crash". The leak was kindly keeping the dangling pointer alive; once the leak is fixed, the alias dangles for real. If the CHANGELOG doesn't call this out, downstreams hit "rebuilt under new aetherc, my server crashes" and run a manual debugging ladder to figure out what changed semantically.

**Template:**

```markdown
### Upgrade notes

This release tightens <ownership behaviour>: <one-sentence statement of the new
runtime guarantee>. The previous version <one-sentence statement of what was
loose / broken before>.

If your project <names the aliasing pattern that's now dangerous, e.g. stores
a heap-string in a long-lived structure and also keeps a local pointer that's
later reassigned>, the previous compiler tolerated this as <a leak / a no-op>;
this release will <name the new visible behaviour, free the alias / panic
on the use / etc.>. This shape is a use-after-free / double-free / etc.

**Recommended pre-upgrade play:**

1. <First step, usually `aetherc --diagnose=ownership` or a similar audit>.
2. <Second step, what to look for in the audit output>.
3. <Third step, sanitiser run, integration test, etc.>
```

Only include the section when the change can plausibly break downstream code that compiled fine before. A pure leak fix that has no UAF surface (e.g. the wrapper is right and only the diagnostic is new) doesn't need one. When in doubt, write the section, the cost of an unneeded note is low; the cost of a surprised porter is a debugging day.

### Building locally

```bash
make ae          # Picks up version from git tags automatically
./build/ae version   # Verify: should show the latest tag
```

If you're building outside a git repo (e.g., from a release tarball):

```bash
make ae          # Falls back to VERSION file
```

## Complex PRs and malware protection

To protect our project from trojan horse compromises, we may reverse your PR back to an intention and do the same change 
from scratch without using your source. We will still credit you as much as we can. That may cause you some rebase pain 
when you get the change back again - sorry. This also allows us to worry less about whether your employer allows you to 
donate open source to projects.
